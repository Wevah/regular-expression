# RegularExpression

A Swifty overlay of `NSRegularExpression`.

Conforms to `CustomStringConvertable` and `Codable`, and supports pattern matching.

Most methods are similar to the Objective-C versions, with the following changes:

- Custom `Match` type for matches.
- Passing `nil` for a range parameter will use the whole string.
- Ranges for invalid/missing ranges will be `nil` instead of `{NSNotFound, 0}`.
